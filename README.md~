# Kaggle Santa TSP

* It's a big problem: **150.000** chimneys

* No only found a path

  - Found two **disjoint** paths: *If one of your paths contains an edge from A to B, your other path must not contain an edge from A to B or from B to A (either order still counts as using that edge)*.
  
  - The score is the larger of the two distances.
  
* Strategy:

  1. Find a simple solution, better as possible.

  2. Find the second solution respecting the constraints.

# Use library vs develop it yourself

* In big problems the performance is very important

* The existing libraries execute the fitness function after the operator (no estimate the change)

* I develop local search, tabu search and simulate annealing **to estimate that change**

* I develop ant colony algorithm because **I don't found any implementation** in R

# First attempt

* Try solve to the complete problem with local search using the two-opt operator from the greddy solution.

![Solution using hill climbing from the greddy solution](images/hill_greddy.png)

* Fitness: 6.804.530

* The greddy heuristic creates **path-crossings**, some of them are dificult to resolve because involve to many chimneys.

# My Greddy solution

* Fitness: 17.938.005

* There isn't path-crossings! :)

* Better to comparing algorithms

# Divide and select a good operator


1. For each subroute of the current solution

   1.1. Select an operator (the best score have more probability of be select)

   1.2. Apply a algorithm a number of interations

   1.3. If there is improvement increase the score of the operator, in other case decrease it

* The algorithms select the operators that get improvings

---
# Population algorithms

* In general need more memory and the fitness estimation of the operations are difficult

---
# Second solution

* Create a second solution from the first:

![Sampling distributions from a jar](images/heuristics_second.png)

* New fitness function using naive:
```
		nF(s) = F(s) + ( F(s)/D ) * 3e
```
* where:

  - D: length of s
  - e: edges coinciding
